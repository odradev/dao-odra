# Urgent
- Unifiy U256 and U512 to be Balance in contract and tests.

# Other
- Unify ContractRefsStorage and ContractRefsWithKycStorage.
- VotingEngine should have KycInfo features.
- finish_voting returns VotingSummary, but when used via delegate as an entrypoint it should not return anything. Allow Odra to supress return value?
- remove refs from voters?
